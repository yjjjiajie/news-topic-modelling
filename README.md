# news-topic-modelling

The aim of this project is to categorise news headline into various unique topics. The data is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews. Topic modelling provides us with methods to organize, understand and summarize large collections of textual information. From there, we will be able to reduce the scope of large dataset and be able to dive in to our field of study.
